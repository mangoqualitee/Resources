A hard puzzle with a beautiful solution.
:::

##### The Problem

> Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of at least two points in the plane. Assume that no three points of $\mathcal{S}$ are collinear. By a windmill we mean a process as follows. Start with a line $\ell$ going through a point $P \in \mathcal{S}$. Rotate $\ell$ clockwise around the pivot $P$ until the line contains another point $Q$ of $\mathcal{S}$. The point $Q$ now takes over as the new pivot. This process continues indefinitely, with the pivot always being a point from $\mathcal{S}$.
>
> Show that for a suitable $P \in \mathcal{S}$ and a suitable starting line $\ell$ containing $P$, the resulting windmill will visit each point of $\mathcal{S}$ as a pivot infinitely often.
